# HASKI-Frontend

The bridge between AI backend models and a Learning Management System (LMS), wrapped nicely as a web application üéÅ.

The complete **technical documentation** can be found [here](https://wiki.haski.app).

## Setup

- Install a JavaScript Runtime like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- If you choose to use yarn as a package manager, install it globally via `npm install --global yarn`, otherwise use the `npm` equivalents in the following steps.
- Navigate into the root project directory, where `package.json` lays.
- Install the project dependencies via `yarn install`
- Modify the `.env.development` or `.env.production file` to your needs (see below).

### Environment variables

To make the variables available during execution, you have to create a `env.development.json` and a `env.production.json` file in the public/config/ directory of the project.
The content of the files should look like this:

```json
{
    BACKEND="http://fakedomain.com:5000"
    MOODLE="http://fakedomain.com"
    LOG_LEVEL="debug"
    NODE_ENV="development"
}
```

Adapt the values to your needs. The `BACKEND` variable is the URL of the backend API. The `MOODLE` variable is the URL of the Moodle instance. The `LOG_LEVEL` variable is the log level of the application (trace, debug, info, warn, error). The `NODE_ENV` variable is the environment of the application.

### Scripts

- Run for development: `yarn start`
- Build for production: `yarn build-prod`
- Serve production build: `yarn serve -s dist`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- For linting: `yarn lint`

### Docker

The volume `/public/config` contains the configuration files for the application. You can mount a local directory to this volume to use your own configuration files. the nginx server will serve the files in this directory. The default configuration files are located in the `public/config` directory of the project.

- Build docker image: `docker build -t haski-frontend:latest .`
- Run docker image: `docker run -p 8080:80 -v /public/config:/usr/share/nginx/html/config haski-frontend:latest`

## Development

### Documentation

The documentation is located in the [wiki](https://wiki.haski.app). The project is structured in the following way:

- [Common](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/common)
- [Components](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/components)
- [Core](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/core)
- [Pages](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/pages)
- [Services](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/services)
- [Shared](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/shared)
- [Store](https://wiki.haski.app/modules/store)

### Architecture

The frontend is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](

### Code style

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce a consistent code style. A .prettierrc file is also included to format the code automatically.
Run `yarn lint` to check for errors.
It also runs `unimported` to check for unused imports. You will be prompted to install this package if you run `yarn lint` for the first time. You can run `yarn lint --fix` to fix some of the errors automatically.

### Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a testing framework. Tests are located besides the actual files. The naming convention for test files is `*.test.(ts/tsx)`.
