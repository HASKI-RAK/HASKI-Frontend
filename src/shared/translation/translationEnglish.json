			"term": "Adaptability",
			"definition": "The adaptability of a system means that it can be changed by external actions regarding its program settings. The HASKI system is adaptable for teachers and for learners. While teachers can e.g. intervene in the suggested learning paths, learners can independently modify certain basic settings. The latter can be e.g. changing colors or configuring their own sequence of learning elements.",

			"term": "Adaptivity",
			"definition": "Adaptivity is present in a system when it independently adapts to input (e.g., test results, processing speed, learning paths, etc.). 'Adaptivity enables continuous adjustment of the system at short intervals' (Petko & Reusser 2005, p.188). In this context, adaptive learning means 'adapting the learning offer to the individual differences of the learners so that all can be supported equally' (Stangl 2022, p.1). "
