Learning paths can be constructed by teachers and by the HASKI system.

At the end of a learning path there is successful knowledge generation and competence development in relation to the content passed through. Learners are enabled to go through learning paths at their individual pace (cf. Pöhler 2018; Hessian Ministry of Education 2016; Roth 2014). There are two types of learning paths: linear, which connects the learning elements, learning spaces, and topics in the same order for all learners, and adaptive, which adapts individually to students. This adaptive learning path can then be differentiated with respect to the included data. In the context of HASKI, adaptation is done by the tutorial model based on the data available in the learner model about the respective individuals and the basic structure of the domain model (see also Niegemann & Heidig 2020, p. 362; Goertz 2015; Paramythis & Loidl-Reisinger 2004; Bartel, Dörringer & Klopp 2022, p.1).",
